                    Medicare is a health insurance program administered by the U.S.
                    federal government since 1966. Under the program, some or all of the
                    health care costs are paid for by the government. The program is
                    funded by a payroll tax, premiums, and surtaxes paid by
                    beneficiaries, as well as general revenue. Medicare is the primary
                    health insurance program for people aged 65 and older and for
                    certain younger people with disabilities. It also covers people with
                    end-stage renal disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou
                    Gehrig's disease). Medicare is the largest single-payer health care
                    program in the world, providing health insurance to an estimated 57
                    million people in 2019. In 2019, Medicare provided health insurance
                    to approximately 49 million aged people, and 8 million people with
                    <!-- disabilities. In 2019, Medicare cost $716.5 billion, accounting for
                    15.4% of the federal budget. Medicare is funded by a payroll tax of
                    1.45% each of the employee and the employer, and a 0.9% surtax on
                    the employee and employer portion of the payroll tax for those
                    earning more than $200,000 ($250,000 for joint filers). In 2019, the
                    combined payroll tax and premium income was $1.02 trillion. Medicare
                    spends $1.1 trillion on benefits. Medicare is funded by a payroll
                    tax, premiums, and surtaxes paid by beneficiaries, as well as
                    general revenue. Medicare is the primary health insurance program
                    for people aged 65 and older and for certain younger people with
